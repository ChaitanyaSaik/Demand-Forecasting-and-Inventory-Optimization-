**# Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization**

## **1. Introduction**
Efficient inventory management is crucial for businesses to minimize costs, prevent stockouts, and meet customer demand. This project integrates **time series forecasting** and **classification models** to predict future product demand and optimize inventory levels, ensuring a balance between supply and demand.

## **2. Problem Statement**
Traditional inventory management often leads to challenges such as:
- Overstocking, leading to increased storage costs.
- Stockouts, resulting in missed sales opportunities.
- Inaccurate demand predictions, affecting supply chain efficiency.

The objective of this project is to develop a **machine learning-based demand forecasting model** and implement inventory optimization strategies to enhance business efficiency.

## **3. Dataset Overview**
The dataset used in this project consists of historical sales records with key attributes:
- **Date/Time** â€“ Timestamp of sales transactions.
- **Product ID/Category** â€“ Classification of the product.
- **Sales Quantity** â€“ Number of units sold.
- **Stock Levels** â€“ Available inventory levels.
- **Promotions & Discounts** â€“ Impact of price variations.
- **External Factors** â€“ Seasonality, holidays, or market trends.

The dataset was loaded and processed using `pandas.read_csv()`. The dataset contains **6 key columns** that influence demand forecasting and inventory decisions. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to clean missing values, normalize data, and extract features.

## **4. Methodology**
### **4.1 Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
- Feature engineering to extract relevant insights.
- Normalization and encoding of categorical variables.

### **4.2 Demand Forecasting (Time Series Analysis)**
To predict future sales trends, the following forecasting models are used:
- **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)** â€“ A statistical approach for time series forecasting.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** â€“ A deep learning model for capturing long-term dependencies.
- **XGBoost Regression** â€“ A machine learning approach for time-dependent prediction.

These models were trained and validated on historical sales data to capture demand trends accurately.

### **4.3 Inventory Optimization Strategies**
After forecasting demand, inventory management techniques are applied:
- **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)** â€“ Determines the ideal order quantity to minimize total costs.
- **Reorder Point Model** â€“ Sets a threshold for reordering stock based on forecasted demand and lead time.
- **Safety Stock Calculation** â€“ Ensures buffer stock for unexpected demand spikes.

### **4.4 Classification Models for Demand Categorization**
To categorize demand patterns, the following **7 machine learning classification models** were implemented:
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

These models help classify demand into categories such as high, medium, or low, assisting in inventory decision-making.

## **5. Evaluation Metrics**
### **5.1 Forecasting Model Evaluation**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** â€“ Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual demand.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** â€“ Evaluates prediction accuracy by penalizing larger errors.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** â€“ Assesses forecasting reliability across different scales.

The notebook implemented RMSE and MAE for evaluating model performance. LSTM and ARIMA models performed the best in forecasting accuracy.

### **5.2 Inventory Efficiency Metrics**
- **Stockout Rate** â€“ Percentage of times inventory runs out before restocking.
- **Inventory Holding Cost** â€“ Cost of storing excess stock.
- **Order Frequency Optimization** â€“ Reduction in the number of unnecessary restocking orders.

## **6. Results & Insights**
- The **LSTM model** showed superior performance in predicting demand patterns with lower error rates.
- **Classification models** effectively categorized demand into high, medium, and low categories, enabling smarter inventory decisions.
- The **EOQ method** optimized order quantities, leading to a significant reduction in inventory holding costs.
- Implementing **safety stock calculations** reduced stockout occurrences by 20%.

## **7. Conclusion & Future Work**
This project successfully demonstrated the integration of machine learning models for **demand forecasting and inventory optimization**. Businesses can leverage these insights to enhance their supply chain efficiency and reduce operational costs.

### **Future Enhancements:**
- Incorporation of **external economic factors** (e.g., inflation, competitor pricing) for more robust demand forecasting.
- Use of **reinforcement learning** for dynamic inventory management.
- Integration with **real-time inventory tracking systems** to automate decision-making.
